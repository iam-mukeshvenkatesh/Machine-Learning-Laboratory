MACHINE LEARNING LAB REPOSITORY:
Welcome to the Machine Learning Lab repository! This repository contains practical implementations and projects related to Machine Learning concepts covered during lab sessions.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:
The EDA_diabets.ipynb notebook is the first step in any data science or machine learning project. This file demonstrates how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand the structure, patterns, and insights 
hidden in raw data.

KEY TOPIC COVERED:
Data Cleaning
Data Visualization
Statistical Analysis
Handling Missing Values
Outlier Detection

FUTURE UPDATES:
Stay tuned for more updates! This repository will include additional notebooks covering topics such as:
  Machine Learning Algorithms
  Feature Engineering
